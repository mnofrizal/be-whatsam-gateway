# WhatsApp Gateway PaaS - Product Definition

## 🎯 What We're Building

**WhatsApp Gateway PaaS Backend** is the central orchestrator for a multi-tenant WhatsApp messaging platform. It serves as the API gateway that manages users, orchestrates WhatsApp workers, handles session routing, and provides unified APIs for both frontend dashboard and external integrations.

## 🔍 Problems We Solve

### For Businesses

- **Reliable WhatsApp API Access:** Businesses need stable WhatsApp integration for customer service without dealing with complex Baileys setup
- **Scalable Messaging:** Handle thousands of WhatsApp sessions across multiple workers without manual management
- **Multi-Session Management:** Manage multiple WhatsApp accounts/sessions from a single dashboard

### For Developers

- **Simple Integration:** Clean REST APIs for WhatsApp functionality without Baileys complexity
- **Session Persistence:** Automatic session recovery and failover when workers go down
- **Load Balancing:** Automatic distribution of sessions across available workers

### For Enterprises

- **High Availability:** 99.9% uptime with automatic failover and session migration
- **Resource Isolation:** Dedicated workers for premium customers
- **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Real-time analytics and worker health monitoring

## 🏗️ How It Works

### Core Architecture

```
Customer/Admin → Frontend Dashboard → Backend API Gateway → WhatsApp Workers → Baileys → WhatsApp
```

### Key Workflows

**User Onboarding:**

1. User registers via frontend → Backend creates account with API key
2. User creates WhatsApp session → Backend assigns to available worker
3. Worker generates QR code → User scans → Session becomes active

**Message Processing:**

1. API call with message → Backend validates API key and session
2. Backend routes to appropriate worker based on session mapping
3. Worker sends via Baileys → WhatsApp → Response tracked in database

**High Availability:**

1. Backend monitors worker health every 30 seconds
2. If worker fails → Backend triggers session migration to healthy worker
3. Sessions automatically reconnect without user intervention

## 🎛️ User Experience Goals
