- âœ… Example requests and responses
- âœ… Authentication examples for both admin and worker tokens
- âœ… Error response documentation

#### Route Architecture (âœ… COMPLETE)

**Main Routes Index** (`src/routes/index.js`):

- âœ… All routes properly integrated
- âœ… API versioning with `/v1` prefix
- âœ… Health check and documentation endpoints
- âœ… Consistent route mounting pattern

**MVP Route Pattern** (All route files):

- âœ… `auth.routes.js` - Authentication endpoints (implemented)
- âœ… `user.routes.js` - User management endpoints (implemented)
- âœ… `worker.routes.js` - Worker management endpoints (implemented)
- âœ… `session.routes.js` - Session management endpoints (MVP placeholders)
- âœ… `admin.routes.js` - Admin dashboard endpoints (MVP placeholders)
- âœ… `api.routes.js` - External API endpoints (MVP placeholders)

### Architecture Patterns Implemented

#### 1. Standardized Controller Pattern

```javascript
// ES6 imports
import { asyncHandler } from "../middleware/error-handler.js";
import { ApiResponse } from "../utils/helpers.js";

// Static methods with asyncHandler
static getWorkers = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  // Implementation
  return res.status(HTTP_STATUS.OK).json(
    ApiResponse.createSuccessResponse(data, message)
  );
});
```

#### 2. Standardized Service Pattern

```javascript
// ES6 class with Prisma outside
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export class WorkerService {
  // Methods implementation
}

// Export default instance
export default new WorkerService();
```

#### 3. Hybrid Data Management Pattern

- **Backend owns:** User accounts, session metadata, worker registry, usage records
- **Worker owns:** Messages, session state, media files, QR codes
- **Data sync strategies:** Real-time (critical), batch (analytics), on-demand (historical)

#### 4. MVP Development Pattern

- **Implemented routes:** Full functionality with controllers and services
- **Placeholder routes:** NOT_IMPLEMENTED responses with detailed API specifications
- **Progressive implementation:** Week-by-week feature rollout

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

1. **Session Management Implementation:**
   - Create SessionController following established patterns
   - Implement SessionService with two-phase session creation
   - Create ProxyService for worker communication
   - Implement Redis integration for session routing

2. **Two-Phase Session Architecture Implementation:**
   - **Phase 1:** `POST /sessions` - Create session card (database only, status: DISCONNECTED)
   - **Phase 2:** `POST /sessions/{id}/connect` - Assign worker, generate QR, start connection
   - **QR Code Flow:** Worker generates QR â†’ Backend stores â†’ Frontend polls â†’ User scans â†’ Status updates
   - **Status Tracking:** Real-time polling for session status updates (DISCONNECTED â†’ QR_REQUIRED â†’ CONNECTED)

3. **Required Session Endpoints:**
   - `POST /sessions` - Create session card (Phase 1)
   - `GET /sessions` - List user sessions for dashboard
   - `GET /sessions/{id}` - Get session details for panel page
   - `POST /sessions/{id}/connect` - Start connection process (Phase 2)
   - `GET /sessions/{id}/qr` - Get QR code for display
   - `GET /sessions/{id}/status` - Poll session status for real-time updates
   - `DELETE /sessions/{id}` - Delete session

### Short-term Goals (Week 4)

1. **Session Orchestration:** Route sessions to available workers
2. **Request Proxy System:** Forward requests from backend to workers
3. **QR Code Flow:** Async QR transfer from Worker to Backend via webhooks
4. **Session Status Tracking:** Real-time status updates and polling

### Medium-term Goals (Week 5-6)

1. **Session Migration:** Failover between workers during failures
2. **Message Management:** History, status tracking, delivery confirmation
3. **Webhook System:** Real-time event notifications to external systems
4. **Analytics System:** Usage tracking and reporting

## ðŸš¨ Key Technical Decisions

### Code Standardization Completed

1. **Controller Pattern:** All controllers now use ES6 modules, static methods, asyncHandler, ApiResponse
2. **Service Pattern:** All services use ES6 class, Prisma outside class, export default instance
3. **Route Pattern:** Consistent authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
4. **Testing Pattern:** REST files with comprehensive examples and documentation

### Worker Management Architecture

1. **Self-Registration:** Workers can register themselves with backend
2. **Health Monitoring:** Background service checks worker health every 30 seconds
3. **Load Balancing:** Round-robin with resource consideration (CPU, memory, session count)
4. **Admin Management:** Full CRUD operations for manual worker management
5. **Statistics:** Real-time worker metrics and system overview

### MVP Implementation Strategy

1. **Progressive Rollout:** Implement features week by week
2. **API-First Design:** All endpoints documented before implementation
