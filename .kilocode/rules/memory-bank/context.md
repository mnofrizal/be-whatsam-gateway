### Architecture Patterns Implemented

#### 1. Standardized Controller Pattern

```javascript
// ES6 imports
import { asyncHandler } from "../middleware/error-handler.js";
import { ApiResponse } from "../utils/helpers.js";

// Static methods with asyncHandler
static getWorkers = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  // Implementation
  return res.status(HTTP_STATUS.OK).json(
    ApiResponse.createSuccessResponse(data, message)
  );
});
```

#### 2. Standardized Service Pattern

```javascript
// ES6 class with Prisma outside
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export class WorkerService {
  // Methods implementation
}

// Export default instance
export default new WorkerService();
```

#### 3. Hybrid Data Management Pattern

- **Backend owns:** User accounts, session metadata, worker registry, usage records
- **Worker owns:** Messages, session state, media files, QR codes
- **Data sync strategies:** Real-time (critical), batch (analytics), on-demand (historical)

#### 4. MVP Development Pattern

- **Implemented routes:** Full functionality with controllers and services
- **Placeholder routes:** NOT_IMPLEMENTED responses with detailed API specifications
- **Progressive implementation:** Week-by-week feature rollout
