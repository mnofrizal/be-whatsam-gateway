# WhatsApp Gateway PaaS Backend - Current Context

## 🎯 Current Status

**Project Phase:** Initial Setup - Fresh Project  
**Last Updated:** January 2, 2025  
**Development Stage:** Pre-Development (Memory Bank Initialization)

## 📋 Current Work Focus

### Immediate Priority: Project Foundation

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** ✅ Completed - Establishing project documentation foundation
- **Project Structure Setup:** 🔄 Next - Create initial Node.js/Express project structure
- **Database Schema Design:** 📋 Pending - Design Prisma schema for PostgreSQL
- **Core Dependencies:** 📋 Pending - Setup package.json with required dependencies

### Development Roadmap Status

**Week 1-2: Foundation (Current)**

- Project initialization and memory bank setup
- Core technology stack setup (Node.js, Express, Prisma, Redis)
- Database schema design and initial migrations
- Basic authentication system implementation

**Week 3-4: Core Features**

- User management system
- Worker orchestration logic
- Session routing implementation
- Load balancing algorithms

**Week 5-6: Advanced Features**

- Admin APIs and worker management
- Analytics and monitoring
- Production hardening

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

### Technology Stack Confirmed

- **Runtime:** Node.js 18+
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching:** Redis (ioredis)
- **Authentication:** JWT + bcrypt
- **Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Process Management:** PM2 (production)

### Architecture Patterns

- **API Gateway Pattern:** Central orchestrator for all requests
- **Microservices Communication:** REST APIs between backend and workers
- **Multi-tenancy:** User isolation with JWT and API keys
- **Load Balancing:** Round-robin with resource consideration
- **Session Persistence:** Redis for routing, PostgreSQL for metadata

## 📁 Project Structure Plan

Based on the brief, the following structure will be implemented:

```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/     # Route handlers
│   ├── services/        # Business logic
│   ├── middleware/      # Auth, validation, rate limiting
│   ├── models/          # Data models
│   ├── utils/           # Helper functions
│   ├── routes/          # API routes
│   ├── config/          # Configuration files
│   └── prisma/          # Database schema and migrations
├── logs/                # Application logs
├── .env.example         # Environment template
├── Dockerfile           # Container configuration
└── package.json
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

1. **Initialize Node.js Project:** Create package.json with dependencies
2. **Setup Project Structure:** Create directory structure and basic files
3. **Database Setup:** Design Prisma schema for core entities
4. **Basic Express Server:** Setup minimal server with health check

### Short-term Goals (Week 1-2)

1. **Authentication System:** JWT-based auth with user registration/login
2. **Database Models:** User, Session, Worker, ApiKey entities
3. **Basic APIs:** User management and session CRUD operations
4. **Worker Registration:** Basic worker discovery and health monitoring

### Medium-term Goals (Week 3-4)

1. **Session Orchestration:** Route sessions to available workers
2. **Load Balancing:** Implement worker selection algorithms
3. **Proxy Service:** Forward requests from backend to workers
4. **Admin APIs:** Worker management and system monitoring

## 🚨 Key Considerations

### Critical Dependencies

- **Worker Communication:** Backend must communicate with WhatsApp workers via REST APIs
- **Session Routing:** Redis-based routing table for session-to-worker mapping
- **Health Monitoring:** Regular health checks to detect worker failures
- **Session Migration:** Ability to move sessions between workers during failures

### Security Requirements

- **API Authentication:** JWT for dashboard, API keys for external access
- **Rate Limiting:** Tier-based limits (Free: 100/hour, Pro: 1000/hour, Premium: 10000/hour)
- **Input Validation:** All API inputs must be validated and sanitized
- **Worker Authentication:** Internal token for worker-to-backend communication

### Performance Targets

- **Response Time:** <200ms for API calls
- **Throughput:** >10,000 requests/minute
- **Concurrent Users:** Support 1000+ concurrent users
- **Database Performance:** <50ms query time average

## 📊 Development Metrics

### Current Progress

- **Memory Bank:** 100% Complete
- **Project Setup:** 0% Complete
- **Core Features:** 0% Complete
- **Testing:** 0% Complete
- **Documentation:** 25% Complete (Memory Bank only)

### Quality Gates

- [ ] All APIs must have Swagger documentation
- [ ] Minimum 80% test coverage for core services
- [ ] All database queries must be optimized (<50ms)
- [ ] Security audit before production deployment
- [ ] Load testing with 1000+ concurrent users

## 🔄 Recent Changes
