#### Socket.IO Real-time Architecture Patterns

#### 1. Real-time Event Broadcasting Pattern

```javascript
// Socket.IO service with singleton pattern
class SocketService {
  constructor() {
    this.io = null;
    this.server = null;
  }

  initialize(server) {
    this.server = server;
    this.io = new Server(server, { cors: { origin: "*" } });
    this.setupAuthentication();
    this.setupEventHandlers();
  }

  emitToUser(userId, event, data) {
    this.io.to(`user_${userId}`).emit(event, data);
  }
}
```

#### 2. Session-Specific Room Management Pattern

```javascript
// Room-based broadcasting for session-specific events
const roomName = `session_${sessionId}`;
socketService.emitToRoom(roomName, "qr_code_update", {
  sessionId,
  qrCode: rawQrString,
  status: "qr_required",
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

#### 3. JWT WebSocket Authentication Pattern

```javascript
// JWT authentication middleware for Socket.IO
io.use(async (socket, next) => {
  try {
    const token = socket.handshake.auth.token;
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    socket.userId = decoded.userId;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    next(new Error("Authentication failed"));
  }
});
```

#### 4. Worker Self-Unregistration Pattern

```javascript
// Worker self-service unregistration with proper authentication
router.delete(
  "/unregister",
  authenticateWorker, // Worker token authentication
  validateWorkerRegistration,
  WorkerController.unregisterWorker
);

// Separate from admin-only worker removal
router.delete(
  "/:workerId",
  authenticateJWT, // Admin JWT authentication
  validateWorkerId,
  WorkerController.removeWorker
);
```

### Architecture Patterns Implemented

#### 1. Standardized Controller Pattern

```javascript
// ES6 imports
import { asyncHandler } from "../middleware/error-handler.js";
import { ApiResponse } from "../utils/helpers.js";

// Static methods with asyncHandler
static getWorkers = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  // Implementation
  return res.status(HTTP_STATUS.OK).json(
    ApiResponse.createSuccessResponse(data, message)
  );
});
```

#### 2. Standardized Service Pattern

```javascript
// ES6 class with Prisma outside
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export class WorkerService {
  // Methods implementation
}

// Export default instance
export default new WorkerService();
```

#### 3. Hybrid Data Management Pattern

- **Backend owns:** User accounts, session metadata, worker registry, usage records
- **Worker owns:** Messages, session state, media files, QR codes
- **Data sync strategies:** Real-time (critical), batch (analytics), on-demand (historical)

#### 4. MVP Development Pattern

- **Implemented routes:** Full functionality with controllers and services
- **Placeholder routes:** NOT_IMPLEMENTED responses with detailed API specifications
- **Progressive implementation:** Week-by-week feature rollout

- **Worker Management System:** Complete implementation with enhanced heartbeat monitoring and intelligent load balancing
- **Code Standardization:** All controllers use ES6 modules, static methods, asyncHandler, ApiResponse patterns
- **Enhanced Load Balancing:** Multi-factor scoring algorithm using session breakdown data, resource usage, and connection stability
- **Session Breakdown Monitoring:** Detailed session status tracking (connected, disconnected, qr_required, error) for better health monitoring
- **Backward Compatibility:** Support for both legacy sessionCount and enhanced session breakdown structures
- **Redis Caching Strategy:** Enhanced worker data storage for fast load balancing decisions
- **Worker Environment Management:** Added version and environment fields to Worker model with proper validation

**Key Technical Improvements:**

- **Authentication Consistency:** All middleware now uses `Authorization: Bearer {token}` format
- **Standard HTTP Headers:** Eliminated custom headers in favor of RFC-compliant authentication
- **Enhanced Worker Monitoring:** Intelligent load balancing with session health data
- **Database Schema Evolution:** Worker model enhanced with version and environment tracking
- **Error Handling:** Consistent custom error classes and ApiResponse format
- **Validation:** Centralized validation logic with ValidationHelper
- **Logging:** Proper logging patterns with authentication method tracking

**Critical Architecture Achievements:**

- **Hybrid Data Management:** Clear separation between Backend (business data) and Worker (operational data)
- **Two-Phase Session Architecture:** Session creation separated from WhatsApp connection process
- **Worker Orchestration:** Complete worker discovery, health monitoring, and load balancing system
- **Authentication Standardization:** Unified Bearer token authentication across all endpoints
